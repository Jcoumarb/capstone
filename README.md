- This is Chrome browser extension that meant to gamify productivity
- It implements a point system that increments every 5 minutes of work
- Points are reduced for visiting distracting websites that are enumerated in a modifiable blacklist
- There is also a scheduled break every 30 minutes where the user can visit distracting websites without point loss

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install

npm run build
```

To run this extension in your browser, you will need to take the generated 'dist' directory and load it as an unpacked extension
